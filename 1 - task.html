    <h1>Task</h1>
    <p>
      Mr M Lassey set a task:<br><br>

      CPU Architecture Website<br><br>

      Due: Tuesday 30th October<br><br>

      Task Description<br><br>

      Using Thimble:<br><br>

      Create a website which could be used to explain the internal components of a Central Processing Unit.<br><br>

      Pay particular attention to the Stored Program Concept and how it relates to RAM, Registers and individual buses.<br><br>

      Please consult the A level specification (available on firefly) for examples of the HTML and CSS you need to learn as part of this course - I highly recommend that you include as many examples as possible to show you understand what each tag or css function does.<br><br>

      Use of appropriate images to explain the elements is strongly recommended.<br><br>

      Try to produce the best looking site you can - don't go crazy with the colours though!<br><br>

      Please publish your website when complete and add the link as a comment to this task.
