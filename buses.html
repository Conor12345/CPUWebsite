    <h2>What are buses?</h2>
    
    <p>Buses are the wires/connections which join together different components of the CPU (and the wider computer) allowing them to communicate, sending data all around the computer.</p>
    
    <h2>Which buses are present in the CPU?</h2>
    
    <h3>Address Bus</h3>
    
    <p>The address bus is used to tell other register which memory address in the RAM is currently being read from or written to.</p>
    
    <h3>Data Bus</h3>
    
    <p>The data bus is the main bus used to move data around the CPU, generally from the <a href="memory.html">memory</a> to <a href=registers.html>MDR</a> or back again.</p>
