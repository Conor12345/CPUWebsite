    <h2>What is memory?</h2>
    
    <p>Memory is the fast storage that can be accessed by the CPU directly.  This is where the instructions for the CPU are stored aswell the data it will perform the actions upon.</p>

    <p>All the RAM in a computer is broken down into thousands of different "chunks" of memory, they are often each 1 byte (8 bits) in size and known as a memory location.  Each location in the memory has an address to allow the computer to access the data inside.</p>

    <p>
      Each byte in memory is split into two parts, the Opcode and the Operand.  The opcode tells the CPU what to do with the data it's provided.  The operand is the data the CPU will perform the action upon.  Often the operand section will just "point" to a different memory location rather than containing the data itself.
