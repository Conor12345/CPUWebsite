    <h2>What is a register?</h2>
    <p>A register is a small amount of memory.  The CPU has many of these small "chunks" of memory, each with a different purpose.</p>
    
    
    <h2>What types of register are in a CPU?</h2>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Memory Data Register</td>
        <td>MDR</td> 
        <td>This is where data from the RAM is stored to be used by the <a href=stored_program_concept.html>ALU</a> in the CPU.  Only data is stored here, any CPU instructions are stored in CIR.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Current Instruction Register</td>
        <td>CIR</td> 
        <td>If the data from <a href=memory.html>memory</a> is deemed to an instruction, it is put into to CIR.  This is how the other CPU components know what to do with the data.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Memory Address Register</td>
        <td>MAR</td> 
        <td>This is the register which stores the memory address which the <a href=buses.html> buses</a> needed to move to the MDR or CIR.  Each <a href=memory.html>memory</a> location has its own address which the address bus can select, allowing the data bus to retrieve the data.  This process is also reversed to store data into memory.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Status Register</td>
        <td>SR</td> 
        <td>The status register stores information about the CPU as a whole to ensure everything is co-ordinated and working correctly.  If any of the components of the CPU have an error the status register is changed to alert the rest of the CPU components.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Program Counter</td>
        <td>PC</td> 
        <td>The program counter is used to keep the whole CPU synchronized around the same <a href=memory.html> memory </a>address.  The PC increments by one every time the CPU is finished with a memory location to instruct the process to being again on the next memory location.</td>
