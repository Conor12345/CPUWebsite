    The stored program concept is an abstraction for the way a computer works, it is a simplified way of thinking about how the computer works though in reality it is much more complex.  Before reading this explanation read about: <a href="buses.html">Buses</a>, <a href=memory.html>Memory</a> and <a href=registers.html>Registers</a> <br> <br>
    
    When the CPU is turned on, data is loaded from storage into memory.  Now the CPU will go through the memory, one memory address at a time doing "Stuff" to the data inside.  The CPU knows which memory address to use thanks to the program counter which counts upwards, increasing by one after the CPU is finished with each memory address.  This tells the Memory Address register which memory location to "point" to, which in turn tells the data bus which memory location's data it should move to the MDR (or CIR).  If the data is an instruction, it is moved to the CIR else it goes to the MDR.  Any instructions in the CIR will tell the CPU what it should do with the data it has using the Arithmetic and Logic Unit which can perform very simple mathmatical or logical operations.  Data is then often sent back to memory via the data bus to be stored for later.<br><br>
      
    This process repeats over and over thousands or millions of times per second, repeatedly doing very small logic and maths operations.  We percieve the CPU as a very complex machine doing hundreds of things at once when in reality it does many small operations, very quickly.
